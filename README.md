# AI-Powered Human Trafficking Mitigation
## 🔍 About
This project aims to build an ethical AI solution to help detect, report, and eventually recover victims of human trafficking. Built with tools like R Shiny, Streamlit, and open-source LLMs (LLaMA, Hugging Face), it’s a multi-phase solution rooted in impact and accessibility.

## Overview
This project will use AI and IoT technologies to create a system that helps detect and report instances of human trafficking in real-time. The system will facilitate the swift transfer of information to trusted authorities and organizations dedicated to victim recovery.

## Objectives
- Use AI models to analyze and detect patterns of trafficking.
- Create IoT-enabled solutions for real-time detection and reporting.
- Ensure data privacy and security for all involved.
- Support recovery efforts by linking victims with trusted resources.

## 🚀 Current Phase
**Phase 1: Detection + Reporting**
- AI chatbot interface for schools, shelters, NGOs
- Anonymous and safe reporting system
- Real-time routing to support groups

## 📐 Architecture
A mockup diagram of this phase is in the repo: `Human_Trafficking_Mitigation_S.png`.

## 🛠️ Stack
- R (Shiny)
- Python (Streamlit)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- LLaMA, Mistral (local LLMs)
- HTML/CSS (for UI flow)
- Internet of Things (IoT) Devices
- Data Security & Privacy Technologies
